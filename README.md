# securitytabletops

This open source repository contains Microsoft Word formatted documents for cyber attack tabletop exercises.  These documents are intended to provide facilitators sample questions to ensure they are protected against the attacks described.

## Is there a framework to the documents?

At a minimum, every document should have sections including:
DESCRIPTION: The attack/cyber scenario
ADVANCED: An advanced section with high level questions to evoke the greatest thought and identify gaps in readiness
GUIDED: A guided section that will contain questions around triage, containment, remediation and company processes
BEST PRACTICES: Some contributors may also include an optional best practices section as an aid to the facilitator outlining industry best practices
REFERENCES: An optional section of additional references and reading material to learn more.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the project.  Contributors are invited to refine existing questions and/or contribute new scenarios.  New scenarios should be communicated back to txhacktracker so they can be linked on the website as a featured scenario.
